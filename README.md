# Project: Substrings

This project is a part of The Odin Project Ruby Fundamentals. 

The task was to implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (dictionary) as the second argument. 
It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
